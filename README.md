## Main objectives

* Learn how to connect to a third party API using node.js
* Learn how to implement a CLI program using node.js
* Learn how to work with the filesystem apis of node.js
* Learn how to interact with a CLI program and develop a menu that users can use to know how to execute the program

## Installing
First, you will need to install the dependencies with: npm install.

Run the following command in your terminal after cloning the main repo:

```
$ npm install
```

Next you can install the general command _moviedb_ so you can use it:
